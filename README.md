# ðŸš€ Structural Patterns Debugging Activity â€“ WPF Coffee Shop â˜•  

Welcome to the **Structural Patterns Debugging Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰  
Your task is to **identify and fix errors** in this **C# WPF application** by applying the **correct Structural Design Patterns**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Scenario: Coffee Shop Ordering System â˜•  
You are working on a **coffee shop application** that allows customers to:  
âœ” Order different types of coffee (**Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino**)  
âœ” Add toppings dynamically (**Milk, Sugar**)  
âœ” Integrate an **old coffee system with the new UI**  
âœ” Simplify order processing using a **Facade Pattern**  

ðŸš¨ **But thereâ€™s a problem!**  
- The code is **badly structured** and lacks **proper design patterns**.  
- The UI logic is **hardcoded** instead of using **the Decorator Pattern**.  
- The application **does not correctly integrate an old ordering system** (Adapter Pattern needed).  
- The order processing is **too complex** and should be simplified using a **Facade Pattern**.
